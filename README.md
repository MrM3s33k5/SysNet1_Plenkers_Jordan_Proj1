# SysNet1_Plenkers_Jordan_Proj1
## Systems and Networks I Project 1 source code for Plenkers and Jordan

A simple shell that parses a string input from the user, executes commands from the given arguments, and can handle file redirection.
## Usage
Use "make myshell" to create the shell using the provided Makefile, and run using "./myshell" from the command line.

For the redirects, no spaces can be between the redirect symbol (">" or "<") and the source/destination of the redirect.

The background command ("&") can only appear at the end of command in order for the process to run in the background.

To run in Debug mode, add "-Debug" at the end of command.
